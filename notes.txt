TODO:
- Toggle NSFW filter
- Write code to randomise/re run if NSFW=true until we get safe results
- Could optimise the num_inference_steps on the fly by generation time

Could build a pipeline class which takes image or prompt as input and always returns a video file
Just want to make sure it can be customisable and flexible enough
